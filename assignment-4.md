## Assignment 4: Sharding of the Developed Application

## 1. Project Objective

This assignment involves implementing logical data partitioning (sharding) across multiple simulated nodes or tables. A suitable Shard Key (such as Region, User ID, or Hash value) will be selected, and application logic will be modified to correctly route queries to the appropriate shard. The exercise simulates real-world distributed database systems that scale horizontally to handle large datasets.

## Core Technical Pipeline:

- Shard Key Selection

Choose a suitable key that distributes data evenly across partitions

- Data Partitioning

Implement logical sharding across multiple simulated nodes or tables

- Query Routing

Modify application logic to route queries to the correct shard

- Scalability Analysis

Evaluate trade-offs in your sharded system

## 1. Overview

This assignment focuses on extending your developed application to support horizontal scaling through sharding . You will select an appropriate Shard Key, partition your existing data across multiple simulated nodes or tables, and modify your application logic to correctly route queries to the right shard.

This builds directly on the database schema (Assignment 1), the API and indexing layer (Assignment 2), and the transactional behaviour (Assignment 3) you have already implemented.

## 2. Sharding Implementation

## What is Sharding?

Sharding is a method of horizontal scaling where data is split across multiple partitions (shards), each stored in a separate table or simulated node. Rather than scaling up a single machine (vertical scaling), sharding allows the system to scale out across multiple nodes. Each shard holds a subset of the data, and queries are routed to the correct shard based on the Shard Key.

## Shard Key Selection

A Shard Key determines how records are distributed across shards. Choose a key from your existing schema that satisfies the following:

- High Cardinality: Enough distinct values to spread data evenly
- Query-Aligned: Commonly used in the WHERE clauses of your APIs
- Stable: Does not change frequently after a record is inserted

Suitable candidates include: User ID / Member ID , Region / Location , Date Range , or a Hash of the Primary Key .

## Partitioning Strategies

Implement one of the following strategies and justify your choice:

- Range-Based: Divide records by value ranges of the Shard Key. E.g., IDs 1-1000 → Shard 0, IDs 1001-2000 → Shard 1.
- Hash-Based: Apply a hash function to the Shard Key. E.g., shard\_id = hash(member\_id) % num\_shards .
- Directory-Based: Use a lookup table that maps keys or key ranges to a specific shard, allowing flexible redistribution.

## SubTask 1: Shard Key Selection &amp; Justification

- Choose your Shard Key and justify it against the three criteria above
- Identify the partitioning strategy you will use and explain why it suits your project
- Estimate the expected data distribution across shards and note any risk of skew

## SubTask 2: Implement Data Partitioning

- Create at least three simulated shard tables/nodes in your database
- Migrate your existing data into the appropriate shards based on your chosen strategy
- Ensure each shard contains only its designated subset of data
- Verify that no records are lost or duplicated across shards after migration

How to Simulate Shards: You may use any of the following approaches:

- Docker Instances: Run each shard as a separate database container, simulating distinct physical nodes
- Multiple Databases on the Same Server: Create separate databases with different users on a single server to simulate shard isolation

Note: Docker instances will be provided after 11 April for deployment. Until then, simulate sharding using either approach above.

## Suggested naming convention:

```
shard_0_<table_name> # e.g. shard_0_members, shard_0_orders shard_1_<table_name> shard_2_<table_name>
```

## SubTask 3: Implement Query Routing

Modify your application logic so that every query is directed to the correct shard:

- Lookup queries: Route single-key lookups to the shard that holds that record
- Insert operations: Direct new records to the correct shard on insertion
- Range queries: Identify all shards that may contain relevant records, query each, and merge the results

Modify your existing API endpoints from Assignment 2 to route each incoming request to the correct shard table based on the Shard Key extracted from the query or request body.

## SubTask 4: Scalability &amp; Trade-offs Analysis

Reflect on your sharding design with respect to the following:

- Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling: Explain how sharding differs from simply upgrading a single database server
- Consistency: Can all shards always return the same up-to-date data? When might this break?
- Availability: What happens to your system if one shard goes down?
- Partition Tolerance: How does your design handle a simulated shard failure?

Document your findings clearly in your report. This does not require additional code - a written analysis based on your implementation is sufficient.

## What to Verify

- Correct Partitioning: Data is distributed across shards with no overlap or duplication
- Router Correctness: Lookups, inserts, and range queries all reach the correct shard(s)
- Data Integrity: No records are lost during migration; shards are consistent with the original dataset
- Scalability Analysis: Trade-offs are clearly identified and explained

## Submission

- Report: group\_name\_report.pdf
- Short Video Demonstration

## Report Requirements

First page must include:

- GitHub repository link
- Video link

The report should explain:

- Shard Key chosen and justification
- Partitioning strategy used and why
- How query routing is implemented in your application
- Which SQL shard tables were created and how data was migrated
- The sharding approach used (Docker instances or multiple databases) and how shard isolation was achieved
- Results of the scalability and trade-offs analysis
- Observations and limitations

## Video Requirements

- Show your sharded tables and explain the partitioning logic
- Demonstrate a query being routed to the correct shard
- Show a range query spanning multiple shards, returning correct results
- Briefly explain your scalability trade-offs analysis

## Evaluation Criteria

- Shard Key Selection &amp; Justification.
- Correct sharding of existing data across simulated nodes, no data loss.
- Query Routing.
- Discussion of horizontal scaling, consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.
- Report &amp; Video Demonstration

## Conclusion

The goal is to extend your existing database system with horizontal scaling capabilities through sharding. By selecting an appropriate Shard Key, partitioning your data, and routing queries correctly, you will simulate the core mechanics of how large-scale distributed databases manage data growth. The focus is on understanding the real-world trade-offs of sharding: scalability against consistency and availability.
